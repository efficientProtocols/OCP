/*
 * Hardware-specific Byte Ordering
 *
 * HW_ByteOrder_ facilities define an interface for machine independent
 * presentation of:
 *
 *      Octets, 16 bit Values, 32 bit Values and Octet Strings.
 *
 * These facilities can be used to convert CPU presentation
 * of values to a machine independent byte ordering and vice versa.
 * Most Significant Byte (MSB) of a value is always at the higher address.
 *
 *  Get and Put verbs are with respect to the network.
 *  Get always gets from the network.
 *  Get always has the CPU as the first argument.
 *  Put always puts into the network.
 *  Put always has the NET as the first argument.
 *
 *  NET is always incremented.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT DEPENDENCIES:
 * The following macros are VERY environment specific.  Great care must be
 * taken to provide the services expected from these facilities.  In addition
 * to the CPU specific presentation of 2 byte and 4 byte values, different
 * compilers my handle BO_Swap differently.  Verify the compilers generated
 * code before using these facilities.
 *
