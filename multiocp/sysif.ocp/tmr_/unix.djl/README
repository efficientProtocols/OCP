PORTATION NOTES

This directory contains a sub-directory called "port", which has one
or more options for portation-specific issues.  You should select one
of the files in the "port" sub-directory, or create one of your own
there, and either symbolically-link it, hard-link it, or copy it to
"port.h" in this directory.

	Select one of ./port/* and make it ./port.h
